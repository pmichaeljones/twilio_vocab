# Twilio Vocabulary-Building Application
---
### How It Works
1. User signs up by texting a "starting word" to a Twilio number. Most likely "vocab" but not sure yet.
2. User gets a profile page using phone number app-name-here.com/5553334444.
3. User texts unknown word to Twilio number, app verfies user phone number, makes API call to dictionary API site and saves definition(s) to user's page.
4. User can log into page and study words that they didn't know the day before.
